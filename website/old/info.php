            Wantagh TechDay is an annual event created by Wantagh School District alumni to promote computer science education.  
            Motivated by <u><a href="http://code.org">code.orgâ€™s initiative</a></u>, the Wantagh TechDay team seeks to provide
            the opportunity for exposure to the practical skills of computer science that students could otherwise miss out on.  
            As computers become smaller, more efficient and more powerful, they will exert a stronger influence in all fields 
            and it will become necessary to understand basic notions of how they work and how they can be used. But beyond just 
            giving students a useful tool, we hope to cultivate the joy and enthusiasm we ourselves feel for this rewarding approach 
            to problem solving. Most importantly, when approached the right way, computer science can be fun and our ultimate goal is
            to share the amusement!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Wantagh TechDay exposes students in <strong>5th - 12th grade</strong> to computer science through a project-oriented day in which 
            they learn and utilize a broad array of skills.  Students are organized into small classes based on their experience levels
            and receive instruction from a lecturer and classroom assistants.  By the end of the day, students will have completed a 
            project that will remain accessible.  It is our hope that students will also walk away with the inspiration and ingenuity 
            to attempt a project of their own.

                <p align="justify">
                    After the overwhelming positive feedback from TechDay 2014, and a Brown Bag Seminar at Wantagh Elementary School, 
                    the members of the TechDay team felt that the invitation should be extended to 5th graders as well. Therefore, 
                    Wantagh students in grades <strong>5 - 12</strong> are eligible to sign up. However, please note that 5th grade students <i>must</i> be picked up
                    by a parent or legal guardian at the conclusion of the event. There are no other requirements for signing up other than
                    being excited to learn! So don't worry if you have no prior experience with coding, most of the students won't - there's no
                    reason to be intimidated or feel like you don't know enough to come.

                <p align="justify">
                    Computer Science is one of the fastest growing fields in the modern world. With an estimated 1.4 
                    million new computer science jobs expected over the next 10 years, as well as the assimilation of 
                    tech startup founders into pop culture, one would expect to see the supply of qualified computer 
                    programmers skyrocketing as well. Yet there is expected to be only 400,000 qualified candidates 
                    to fill such positions. This discrepancy is alarming, yet at the same time it provides educators â€“ 
                    especially at the primary and secondary levels â€“ with the opportunity to better equip students for 
                    success in emerging and expanding job markets.

                  and are eager to share their knowledge with fellow students. Most are computer science majors or minors, 
                  but we also have a few who are completely self-taught! Our teachers come from schools like Brown University,
                  University of Delaware, Duke University, Hofstra University, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, 
                  Stony Brook University, and Villanova University. We even have a senior from Wantagh High School on our team!

        This year, we have not yet devoted specific sections to register for. Based on feedback from students, we will be placing students in specific sections based on experience level and interests. We want to maximize everyoneâ€™s potential through this event, so by grouping you with similar students, we can personalize the curriculum to that groupâ€™s interests and skill level. However, you shouldnâ€™t be hesitant to register if you have no experience, most of the students who will register wonâ€™t have any either!  After youâ€™ve received your placement and you feel that youâ€™ve been placed in the wrong section, we are very flexible and will work with you to find the appropriate place for you.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        If you would like to get an idea of what potential section you can be enrolled in, weâ€™ve outlined last yearâ€™s sections below. We will most likely be using Scratch and Python again, so if youâ€™d like to get a head start, you should check out the projects below! Donâ€™t get intimidated by it though, all of our students were able to complete their projects last year, and most had never even heard of coding before!

		                  Students learned how to think like a programmer through MITâ€™s Scratch programming language - specially designed
		                  to help educate students in computer programming. Our only expection for CS.001 was for students to be exited to learn!

        							<strong>Project: </strong><u><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3310840/" target="_blank">Super Swimmer</a></u> is a game
        							that was created by our team in order to introduce the basics of programming to students. It has become quite popular
        							throughout the Scratch community. In this course, each student was given their own Scratch account, and after implementing
        							some of the Super Swimmer functionality, they were able to expand upon the game. Feel free to "remix" this project!

            Those who are interested to get involved with our TechDay team can fill out a <u><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/344IE4vf8C" target="_blank">
            teacher/volunteer registration form</a></u>. We are constantly on the lookout for new talent to join our teaching staff, so don't hesitate 
            to reach out to us! We primarily work in Python and Scratch (developed by MIT Media Lab), but we are always looking to expand to new technologies.
            Don't worry if you're not familiar with either of these languages, we're more than happy to catch you up. Even if you're not a programmer, we can
            still use your help! For any questions concerning becoming a volunteer or teacher, please feel free to email 
            <u><a href="mailto:wantagh.technology@gmail.com">wantagh.technology@gmail.com</a></u>.
